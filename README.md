##### RFC 7118

[SIP over WebSocket](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7118)

##### Plivo

requires
[signup](https://manage.plivo.com/accounts/register/),
provides
[numbers](https://manage.plivo.com/number/)
and
[endpoints](https://manage.plivo.com/endpoint/).

application configuration in the Plivo web UI involves

* associating a SIP endpoint and phone number with an application

* setting the application's "Answer" and "Hangup" URLs to
  ```
  <server_url>/plivourls/answer?caller_id=<phone_number>&sip_username=<sip_username>
  ```
  and
  ```
  <server_url>/plivourls/hangup
  ```
  where `<server_url>` is a publicly visible URL that directs
  HTTP requests to this application's server
  (see [below](#run-server)).

login to the phone with **endpoint** username and password,
_not_ account creds.

----

be sure to

```
find test/ server/ client/ -type f -name '*.example'
```

and duplicate any placeholder credential files --- i.e.

```
cp <path>.example <path>
```

updating the file with valid login information for your account

### cli

##### install

* `json`
* `whitespace`

also accepts verbose `-v` flag

##### test server

```
python -m unittest test_simp_phone
```

##### test client

```

```

see `package.json` for additional `test:` scripts

##### build client

### status

both incoming and outgoing calls are supported,
tho probably buggy.
and be further forewarned that the user interface is a nightmare.

it's recommended to deploy to a remote
_for Plivo callback URLs only_
â€” load the UI from a local dev server.

### thanks

lots of the goodness of the codebase's structure is due
to patterns practiced with

and

at Bargible.

(shouts also to

for their care and tending of the Bargible source).
